# Autoland

This script adds full autoland capability to the autopilot ILS approach mode of GeoFS. It also includes smart go-around detection in case it was set off by a mountain or the aircraft is missing the runway.
It only works on GeoFS aircraft that have autoland capability IRL, which is basically all widebody and narrowbody airliners and about half of all smaller jets. It also works for modern military fighters (F-15, HAL Tejas, F-22, etc.).
